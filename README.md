JAKEX, the first meme coin in the TITANX Ecosystem on Ethereum, launched in February 2024 as a tribute to TITANX founder Jake Sharpe. With fundamentals that capture the pure, fun essence of meme coins, JAKEX has quickly become a powerful community-building tool, encouraging engagement, attracting newcomers, and driving viral attention for the entire ecosystem. While it began as a lighthearted addition, JakeX has grown into an integral part of TITANX's journey, serving as a gateway for the broader crypto market and adding lasting value to the ecosystemâ€™s story.
